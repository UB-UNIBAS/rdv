===============
RDV Version 1.0
===============

The idea of the Research Data Viewer is to make research data visible, searchable and usable, using a simple browser. The matching concept can be called "exploratory search", that was used by Dr. Steffen Vogt for the first time in the project tambora.

The Research Data Viewer consists of three parts:

(1) User interface
(2) Solr proxy
(3) Solr search engine

To create or update the solr index for the different projects look in the folder create.
Each project use a special mapping script. It is also possible to automate the update
procedure (e.g. musse_pub).

The user interface uses jquery and some plugins like treesearch.
