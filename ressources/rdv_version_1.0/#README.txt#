===============
RDV Version 1.0
===============

The idea of the Research Data Viewer is to make research data visible, searchable and usable,
using a simple browser. The matching concept can be called "exploratory search",
proposed by Dr. Steffen Vogt in the project tambora.

The Research Data Viewer consists of three parts:

(1) User interface
(2) Solr proxy
(3) Solr search engine

To create or update the solr index for the different projects look in the folder create.
Each project use a special mapping script. It is also possible to automate the update
procedure (e.g. musse_pub).

The user interface uses jquery and some plugins like treesearch.
